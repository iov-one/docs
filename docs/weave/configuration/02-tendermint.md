## !! Warning this document is out of date. Will be updated in future !!

Tendermint docs provide a [brief introduction](https://tendermint.com/docs/introduction/) to the tendermint cli. By default all files are writen to the `~/.tendermint` directory, unless you override that with a different "HOME" directory by providing `TMHOME=xyz` or `tendermint --home=xyz`.

When you call `tendermint init`, it generates a `config` and `data` directory under the "HOME" dir. `data` will contain all blockchain state as well as the application state. `config` will contain configuration files. There are three main files to look at:

- `genesis.json` must be shared by all validators on a chain and is used to initialize the first block. We discuss this more in [Application Config](#application_config)
- `config.toml` is used to configure your local server, and can be configured much in the way the config for Apache or Postgres, to tune to your local system.
- `priv_validator.json` is used by any validating node to sign the blocks, and must be kept secret. We discuss this more in the [next section](./validators.html).

## Overriding Options

In general, any option you see in [the configuration file](https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/specification/configuration.html) can also be provided via command-line or environmental variable. It is a simple conversion:

Config:

``` {.sourceCode .console}
[rpc]
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:8080"
```

Environment: `export TM_RPC_LADDR=tcp://0.0.0.0:8080` or `export TMRPC_LADDR=tcp://0.0.0.0:8080` (optional \_ after TM)

Command line: `tendermint --rpc.laddr=tcp://0.0.0.0:8080 ...`

## Important Options

There are many options to tune Tendermint, but a few are quite useful when configuring and deploying dev environments or testnets. I will cover them here, but please take a longer look at [all available options](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/config/config.go). I use the command line format for these options, as it seems the most readable, but most of these should be written to the `config.toml` file or stored in environmental options in the service ini (if using 12-factor style).

### Dev

- `--p2p.upnp --proxy_app noop`: Donâ€™t try to determine external address
(noop for local testing)
- `--log_level=p2p:info,evidence:debug,consensus:info,*:error`: Set the log levels for different subsystems (debug, info, error)
- `--tx_index.index_all_tags=true` to enable indexing for search and subscriptions. Should be on for public services, off for validators to conserve resources.
- `--prof_laddr=tcp://127.0.0.1:7777` to open up a profiling server at this port for debugging

### Testnet

- `--moniker=billy-bob` chooses a name to display on the node list to help understand the p2p network connections
- `--mempool.recheck=false` and `--mempool.recheck_empty=false` limit rechecking all leftover tx in mempool, which can help throughput at the expense of possibly invalid tx making it into blocks
- `--rpc.laddr=tcp://0.0.0.0:46657` to change the interface or port we expose the rpc server (what we expose to the world)
- `--p2p.laddr=tcp://0.0.0.0:46656` to change the interface or port we expose the p2p server (what we use to connect to other nodes)
- `--p2p.seeds=tcp://12.34.56.78:46656,tcp://33.44.55.66:46656` to set the seed nodes we connect to on startup to discover the rest of the p2p network
- `p2p.pex=true` turns on peer exchange, to allow us to update the network dynamically
- `--consensus.create_empty_blocks=false` to only create a block when there are tx (otherwise blockchain grows fast even with no activity)
- `--consensus.create_empty_blocks_interval=300` to create a block every 300s even if no tx
- `--consensus.timeout_commit=5000` to set block interval to 5s (5000ms) + time it takes to achieve consensus (which is generally quite small with \< 20 or so well-connected validators)

### Production

- `p2p.persistent_peers=tcp://77.77.77.77:46656` contains peers to which we always remain connected, regardless of peer exchange
- `p2p.private_peer_ids=...` contains peers we do not gossip. This is essential if we have a non-validating node acting as a buffer for a validating node
- `--priv_validator_laddr=???` to use a socket to connect to an hsm instead of using the **priv_validator.json** file

There are quite a few more options, but this is a good place to get started, and you can dig in deeper once you see how these numbers affect blockchains in practice.
