**IOV** is building a Universal Name Service for Wallets.

The IOV Name Service is a registry for names used in the blockchain ecosystem. We believe naming things makes them easier to use for everyone.

## How to Get Started

You can send a transaction or query the IOV Name Service by using our client library [IOV Core](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/iov-core) or by using the [IOVNS-rest-api](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/rest-api).

You're free to explore the GitHub, all feedback is welcome!
