## !! Warning this document is out of date. Will be updated in future !!

Since Tendermint uses a traditional BFT algorithm to reach consensus on blocks, signatures from specified validator keys replace hashes used to mine blocks in typical PoW chains. This also means that the selection of validators is an extremely important part of the blockchain security, and every validator should have strong security in place to avoid their private keys being copied or stolen.

## Static Validators

In the simplest setup, every node can generate a private key with `tendermint init`. Note that this is stored as a clear-text file on the harddrive, so the machine should be well locked-down, and file permissions double-checked. This file not only contains the private key itself, but also information on the last block proposal signed, to avoid double-signing blocks, even in the even of a restart during one round.

Every validator can find their validator public key, which is different than the public keys / addresses that are assigned tokens, via:

```{.sourceCode .console}
cat ~/.mycoind/config/priv_validator.json | jq .pub_key
```

If you still have the default genesis file from tendermint init, this public key should match the one validator registered for this blockchain, so it can mint blocks all by itself.

```{.sourceCode .console}
cat ~/.mycoind/config/genesis.json | jq .validators
```

In a multi-node network, all validators would have to generate their validator key separately, then share the public keys, and forge a genesis file will all the public keys present. Over two-thirds of these nodes must be online, connected to the p2p network, and acting correctly to mint new blocks. Up to one-third faulty nodes can be tolerated without any problems, and larger numbers of nodes usually halt the network, rather than fork it of mint incorrect blocks.

The Tendermint dev team has produced [a simple utility](https://github.com/tendermint/alpha) to help gather these keys.

Note that this liveness requirement means that after initializing the genesis and starting up tendermint on every node, they must set proper `--p2p.seeds` in order to connect all the nodes and get enough signatures gathered to mint the first block.

## HSMs

If we really care about security, clearly a plaintext file on our machine is not the best solution, regardless of the firewall we put on it. For this reason, the tendermint team is working on integrating Hardware Security Modules (HSM) that will maintain the private key secret on specialized hardware, much like people use the Ledger Nano hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.

This is under active development, but please check the following repos to see the current state:

- [Signatory](https://github.com/tendermint/signatory) provides a rust api exposing many curves to sign with
- [YubiHSM](https://github.com/tendermint/yubihsm-rs) provides bindings to a YubiKey HSM
- [KMS](https://github.com/tendermint/kms) is a work in progress to connect these crates via sockets to a tendermint node.

**TODO** Update with current docs, now that cosmos mainnet is live and some people are actually using this.

## Dynamic Validators

A static validator set in the genesis file is quite useless for a real network that is not just a testnet. Tendermint allows the ABCI application to send back messages to update the validator set at the end of every block. Weave-based applications can take advantage of this and implement any algorithm they want to select the validators, such as:

- [PoA](https://github.com/iov-one/weave/issues/32) where a set of keys (held by clients) can appoint the validators. This allows them to bring up and down machines, but the authority of the chain rests in a fixed group of individuals.
- `PoS` or proof-of-stake, where any individual can bond some of their tokens to an escrow for the right to select a validator. Each validator has a voting power proportional to how much is staked. These staked tokens also receive some share of the block rewards as compensation for the work and risk.
- `DPoS` where users can either bond tokens to their own validator, or "delegate" their tokens to a validator run by someone else. Everyone gets some share of the block rewards, but the people running the validator nodes typically take a commission on the delegated rewards, as they must perform real work.

For each of these general approaches there is a wide range of tuning of incentives and punishments in order to achieve the desired level of usability and security.

The only current implementation shipping with Weave is a [POA implementation](https://godoc.org/github.com/iov-one/weave/x/validators#ApplyDiffMsg) allowing some master key (can be a multisig or even an election) update the validator set. This can support systems from testnets to those with strong on-chain governance, but doesn't work for the PoS fluid market-based solution.

If you wish to build an extension supporting PoS, previous related work from cosmos-sdk can be found in their [simple stake](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.15.1/x/simplestake) implementation and the [more complicated DPoS implementation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/x/staking) with incentive mechanisms.
