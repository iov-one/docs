While the blockchain code is in the Go language, we have developed a TypeScript (javascript-compatible) client side sdk in order to access the functionality of the blockchain. Iov-Core works for many blockchains, not just weave (`blog` and `bnsd`), so take a look, it is useful for more than this demo.

## Installing Tooling

You will need node 8+ to run the example client. Unless you know what you are doing, stick to even numbered versions (6, 8, 10, ...), the odd numbers are unstable and get deprecated every few weeks, it seems. For ease
of updating later, I advise you to install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) and then add the most recent stable version.

```sh
# this install most recent v8 version, use lts/dubnium for v10 track
nvm install lts/carbon

# test it out
node --version
node
> let {x, y} = {x: 10, y:10}
```

## Node related tools

Yarn is a faster alternative to npm for installing modules, so we use that as default.

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

## Using IOV Core

Please refer to the offical [IOV Core documentation](https://github.com/iov-one/iov-core/blob/master/packages/iov-core/README.md). Note that you can use the `BnsConnection` to connect to a `blog` blockchain, as long as you restrict it to just sending tokens and querying balances and nonces (it is a subset of `bnsd`). You may also find [iov-cli](https://github.com/iov-one/iov-core/blob/master/packages/iov-cli/README.md) a useful debug tool. It is an enhanced version of the standard node REPL (interactive coding shell), but with support for top-level `await` and type-checks on all function calls (you can code in typescript).

The [iov-core](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-core/index.html) library supports the concept of user profiles and identities. An identity is a [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039)-derived key. Please refer to those docs and tutorials for a deeper dive; it is out of the scope of the weave documentation.
