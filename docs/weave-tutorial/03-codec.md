> [PR#1](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/pull/1): _Create order book models_

Weave defines `Marshaller` and `Persistent` interface standards. These interfaces are automatically implemented by any code autogenerated by protoc from protobuf files, and we recommend using .proto files to specify the serialization format for any persistent data in our application (internal state as well as transactions and messages). However, if you have never worked with protobuf, this might be a bit of a challenge, so here we explain a workflow that we use in Weave-based projects.

## Create Codec file

First imagine the shape of your classes. The product of your imagination will be called `Codec`. And the language of expressing the shape of the classes is: [proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3). There are several different `int encodings`, `byte slices`, `strings`, and nested structures; and fields may be repeated. So it is best to forget complex types with methods and instead focus on the actual data structure.

Codec is the first component that needs to be designed. Keep in mind that this part is the most important as the whole module will depend on _codec_. Codec resembles _model_ in MVC pattern; however. codec not only defines the model representation but also marshalling/unmarshalling and interactions with messages. Codec defines the whole application state models and more. In this article, we will not go as far as explaining every proto message - one example for each message and state should be enough. Furthermore, if you want to see all the implementation, you can check out our [tutorial](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/blob/master/x/orderbook/codec.proto).

## State

In the previous section, we explained how to define your domain attributes and models. Here `Trade` is defined as proto message. The [x/codec.proto](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/blob/master/x/order book/codec.proto#L75-L88) file defines the `Trade` type rather simply, once you remove the comments, this is all that is left:

```protobuf
// Trade is a settled partial/full order
// We store these as independent entities to help with queries to map
// the prices over time. They are also referenced by the Orders, so we can
// see how much was fulfilled.
//
// Ask and Bid tickers are "inherited" from the order book
message Trade {
  weave.Metadata metadata = 1;
  bytes id = 2 [(gogoproto.customname) = "ID"];
  bytes order_book_id = 3 [(gogoproto.customname) = "OrderBookID"];
  bytes order_id = 4 [(gogoproto.customname) = "OrderID"];
  // Address of taker (this is an order that was instantly fulfilled)
  bytes taker = 5 [(gogoproto.casttype) = "github.com/iov-one/weave.Address"];
  // Address of maker (this is an order that was stored first before fulfillment)
  bytes maker = 6 [(gogoproto.casttype) = "github.com/iov-one/weave.Address"];
  // this is how much each side paid (they got the opposite one)
  coin.Coin maker_paid = 7;
  coin.Coin taker_paid = 8;
  // executed_at defines execution time of an order
  int64 executed_at = 9 [(gogoproto.casttype) = "github.com/iov-one/weave.UnixTime"];
}
```

As you can see above, weave is heavily using `bytes` for identities, addresses, etc. At first glance, this might seem difficult to handle but if you take a look at [x/orderbook/bucket](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/blob/master/x/orderbook/bucket.go#L125) you can see it is useful for indexing and performance.

Note that the package defined in the protobuf file must match the package name used by the Go language code in the same directory.

You can also import types from one proto file into another. Make sure to use the full github path so that the generated Go code has properly set imports. The package name above is also used as a namespace for the imported protobuf definitions. This is how [x/cash](https://github.com/iov-one/weave/blob/master/x/cash/codec.proto) creates a wallet that contains an array of tokens of different currencies.
Two critical points needs to be explained in state models and messages.

Firstly, you must have noticed:

```protobuf
weave.Metadata metadata = 1;
```

`weave.Metadata` enables upgrading the code on chain without downtime. It is required if you want to use any [Weave provided extensions](https://github.com/iov-one/weave/tree/master/x). [Migrations](https://github.com/iov-one/weave/tree/v0.20.0/migration) package will be explained in more detail in further sections.

Secondly, note how the magic `ID` field works. This will be explained in [Models](weave-tutorial/04-models.md) section.

## Message Definitions

```protobuf
// CreateOrderMsg will offer to sell some currency on an order book
// at a given price.
message CreateOrderMsg {
  weave.Metadata metadata = 1;
  // Trader is the Address that will pay the offer, and get the matches.
  // Defaults to x.MainSigner() if left blank
  bytes trader = 2 [(gogoproto.casttype) = "github.com/iov-one/weave.Address"];
  // OrderBookID must support Offer.Ticker as one of the two sides,
  // Which side this order will be, is automatically inferred
  bytes order_book_id = 3 [(gogoproto.customname) = "OrderBookID"];
  // Offer is how much will be paid
  coin.Coin offer = 4;
  // Price is how much is requested for each unit of the offer token
  Amount price = 5;
}
```

Noticed `(gogoproto.casttype)` and `(gogoproto.customname)`?

```protobuf
bytes trader = 2 [(gogoproto.casttype) = "github.com/iov-one/weave.Address"];
```

`(gogoproto.casttype)` indicates this field will be cast to `weave.Address`. Compiled codec.pb.go field:

```go
// Address of trader that created order (ad gets paid from it)
    Trader      github_com_iov_one_weave.Address `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=trader,proto3,casttype=github.com/iov-one/weave.Address" json:"trader,omitempty"`
```

```protobuf
bytes order_book_id = 3 [(gogoproto.customname) = "OrderBookID"];
```

`(gogoproto.customname)` indicates this field will be named as `OrderBookID`. Compiled codec.pb.go field:

```go
OrderBookID []byte `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=order_book_id,json=orderBookId,proto3" json:"order_book_id,omitempty"`
```

Without it we would get:

```go
OrderBookId []byte `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=order_book_id,json=orderBookId,proto3" json:"order_book_id,omitempty"`
```

As you can see above, we define necessary fields that will be used by `handler` to interact with application state.

## Compiling Proto Files

To compile protobuf files, you need to have the [protoc](https://github.com/google/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) binary installed and a language-specific translator (gogo-protobuf in this case). This can be a bit of a pain, especially the first time, so the default **weave-starter-kit** [Makefile](https://github.com/iov-one/weave-starter-kit/blob/master/Makefile) contains helpers for you.

### Prototool

At IOV, we use [prototool](https://github.com/iov-one/prototool-docker) for linting, formating and generating protobuf files. It is highly convenient and easy to use. Generating `*.pb.go` files are easy as running `make protoc` with Makefile script. Configuration is easier, just edit `prototool.yaml` or `prototool.json`.

Here is the [prototool.yaml](https://github.com/iov-one/weave-starter-kit/blob/master/prototool.yaml) from **weave-starter-kit**:

```yaml
protoc:
  version: 3.7.1 # Defines which version of protoc to use

  # If not set, compile will fail if there are unused imports.
  # Setting this will ignore unused imports.
  allow_unused_imports: false

  # Import parths
  includes:
    - .
    - /usr/include
    - spec
    - spec/github.com/iov-one/weave

# excluded paths
excludes:
  - .git
  - spec

generate:
  go_options:
    import_path: github.com/iov-one/weave-starter-kit

  plugins:
    - name: gogofaster # Indicates gogofaster will be used.
      type: gogo
      output: .

lint:
  rules:
    remove:
      - FILE_OPTIONS_REQUIRE_JAVA_MULTIPLE_FILES
      - FILE_OPTIONS_REQUIRE_JAVA_OUTER_CLASSNAME
      - FILE_OPTIONS_REQUIRE_JAVA_PACKAGE
      - FILE_OPTIONS_REQUIRE_GO_PACKAGE
```

- `includes` field contains which import paths will be used when running protoc.

  - `.` means that `import "x/custom/codec.go"` will work inside this app (recommended to avoid GOPATH issues)
  - `spec` means that we can `import "github.com/iov-one/weave/coins/codec.proto"` and it will use the protobuf file from our spec directory (which must be kept up to date with the Weave repo).
  - `spec/github.com/iov-one/weave` is needed as if we import eg. `github.com/iov-one/weave/x/cash/codec.proto`, it imports `coins/codec.proto` using relative imports to it's project. When we then import this via spec, the relative import doesn't work without this second line.

- `excludes` field contains which paths to exclude when compiling protobuf. `spec` directory contains the Weave codecs that will be used in modules, so no need to compile these.

```yaml
generate:
  go_options:
    import_path: github.com/iov-one/weave-starter-kit
```

- The base import path. This should be the go path of the prototool.yaml file. This is required if you have any go plugins.

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: gogofaster # Indicates gogofaster will be used.
    type: gogo
    output: .
```

- This part tells prototool to use `gogofaster` plugin and output is current directory.
  You are welcome to use other codecs than `gogofaster`, you can also try the standard Go language protobuf compiler. What this mode goes is auto-generate static code for serialization and deserialization of the type. It performs the introspection one time to generate efficient code allowing us to avoid the use of reflection at runtime and get ~10x speed ups in the serialization/deserialization. I like this, but this may vary based on your preference or aversion of auto-generated code.

- `lint` field defines the linting rules. Extra rules could be added if desired.

After defining your state and messages run `make protoc`. This script will download `prototool` docker image and compile codec.proto file `codec.pb.go` file.
Now we have the scaffold of our application thanks to auto-generated _codec.pb.go_ file.

## Using Autogenerated Structs

The first time through the above process may appear tedious, but once you get the hang of it, you just have to add a few lines to a _.proto_ file and type `make protoc`. Et voila! You have a bunch of fresh \*.pb.go files that provide efficient, portable serialization for your code.

But how do you use those structs? Taking `Amount` from [x/codec.proto](https://orkunkl.github.com/iov-one/tutorial/blob/master/x/order book/codec.proto#L10-L23) as an example, we see a `x/codec.pb.go` file with `type Amount struct {...}` that closely mirrors the content of the codec.proto file, as well as many of methods. There are some auto-generated getters, which can be useful to fulfill interfaces or to query field of _nil_ objects without panicking. And then there are some (very long) **Marshal** and **Unmarshal** methods. These are the meat of the matter. They fulfill the Persistent interface and let us write code like this:

```go
orig := Amount{Whole: 123, franctional: 2}
bz, err := orig.Marshal()
parsed := Amount{}
err = parsed.Unmarshal(bz)
```

This is fine, but what happens when I want to add custom logic to my Amount struct, perhaps adding validation logic, or code to add two coins? Luckily for us, Go allows you two write methods for your structs in any file in the same package. That means that we can just inherit the struct definition and all the serialization logic and just append the methods we care about. [x/amount.go](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/blob/master/x/orderbook/amount.go) is a great example of extending the functionality, with code like:

```go
// IsPositive returns true if the value is greater than 0
func (a *Amount) IsPositive() bool {
    return a.Whole > 0 ||
        (a.Whole == 0 && a.Fractional > 0)
}

// IsNegative returns true if the value is less than 0
func (a *Amount) IsNegative() bool {
    return a.Whole < 0 ||
        (a.Whole == 0 && a.Fractional < 0)
}
```

This is a productive workflow and I recommend trying it out. You may find it doesn’t work for you and you can try other approaches, like copying the protobuf generated structs into some custom-written structs you like and then copying back into protobuf structs for serialization. You can also try playing with special [protobuf extensions](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/extensions.md) flags in your protobuf files to shape the auto-generated code into the exact shape you want.

## Notes About oneof

**oneof** is a powerful feature to produce union/sum types in your protobuf structures. For example, you may have a public key which may be one of many different algorithms and can define cases for each, which can be switched on in runtime. We also use this for the transaction to enumerate a set of possible messages that can be embedded in the transaction. A transaction may have any one of them and serialize and deserialize properly. Type-safety is enforced in compile-time and we can switch on the kind at runtime. (Example from [bcp-demo](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-demo/blob/master/app/codec.proto)):

```protobuf
oneof sum {
  cash.SendMsg send_msg = 1;
  namecoin.CreateTokenMsg new_token_msg = 2;
  namecoin.SetWalletNameMsg set_name_msg = 3;
  escrow.CreateMsg create_escrow_msg = 4;
  escrow.ReleaseMsg release_escrow_msg = 5;
  escrow.ReturnMsg return_escrow_msg = 6;
  escrow.UpdatePartiesMsg update_escrow_msg = 7;
}
```

The only problem is that, to some people, the generated code is ugly. This derives from the fact that there is no clean way to express sum types in Go, and you have to force an interface with private methods to close the set of possible types. Although some people have been so revolted by this code that they preferred to [write their own serialization library](https://github.com/tendermint/go-amino 'go-amino'), I would suggest just taking a deep breath and getting to know it. Here are the relevant pieces:

```go
type Tx struct {
    // msg is a sum type over all allowed messages on this chain.
    //
    // Types that are valid to be assigned to Sum:
    //  *Tx_SendMsg
    //  *Tx_CreateTokenMsg
    //  *Tx_SetNameMsg
    //  *Tx_CreateMsg
    //  *Tx_ReleaseMsg
    //  *Tx_ReturnMsg
    //  *Tx_UpdateEscrowMsg
    Sum isTx_Sum `protobuf_oneof:"sum"`
...
}

type isTx_Sum interface {
    isTx_Sum()
    MarshalTo([]byte) (int, error)
    Size() int
}

type Tx_SendMsg struct {
    SendMsg *cash.SendMsg `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=send_msg,json=sendMsg,oneof"`
}
type Tx_CreateTokenMsg struct {
    CreateTokenMsg *namecoin.CreateTokenMsg `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=new_token_msg,json=newTokenMsg,oneof"`
}
```

We now have some intermediate structs that give us a layer of unidirection in order to enforce the fact we can now securely switch over all possible `tx.Sum` fields, with [code like this](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-demo/blob/master/app/tx.go#L33-61):

```go
sum := tx.GetSum()
switch t := sum.(type) {
case *Tx_SendMsg:
    return t.SendMsg, nil
case *Tx_SetNameMsg:
    return t.SetNameMsg, nil
case *Tx_CreateTokenMsg:
    return t.CreateTokenMsg, nil
case *Tx_CreateMsg:
    return t.CreateMsg, nil
case *Tx_ReleaseMsg:
    return t.ReleaseMsg, nil
case *Tx_ReturnMsg:
    return t.ReturnMsg, nil
case *Tx_UpdateEscrowMsg:
    return t.UpdateEscrowMsg, nil
}
```
