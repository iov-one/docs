**IOV** is building a Universal Name Service for Wallets and Dapps.

The IOV Name Service is a registry for names used in the blockchain ecosystem. We believe naming things makes them easier to use for everyone. We are also providing a toolkit to build blockchain based apps that can easily use and swap all assets from all blockchains. We believe the future of dapps is there.

Enjoy and please send us feedback !

## How to Get Started

The code of the IOV Name Service is in [Weave](/docs/weave/welcome). You can send a transaction or query the IOV Name Service by using our client library [IOV Core](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/iov-core) or by using the [IOVNS-rest-api](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/rest-api).

You're free to explore the GitHub, all feedback is welcome!

## Introduction to IOV

We're building an interoperability solution for the blockchain industry that is open source and totally decentralized. Our product suite thus solves user experience problems. To briefly introduce the product suite:

**IOV Name Service (IOVNS)** is our DNS for crypto-addresses. It is used to register human friendly addresses.

**IOV Core** is the client for the IOV Name Service and for Weave based blockchains. It is designed to run in standard JavaScript environments so that third party app developers can build wallets, blockexplorers, e-commerce payment apps, DEXes, social media tipping apps, etc. that run in standard web browsers.

**IOV Weave** is a framework to quickly build your custom ABCI application to power a blockchain based on the best-of-class BFT Proof-of-stake Tendermint consensus engine. We built IOV Name Service using Weave.

**IOV Chrome Extension** is our Google Chrome Extension to connect to different chains and get a human friendly addresses. It connects to the IOV Wallet (web-based) which demonstrates the different features of IOV Core.
