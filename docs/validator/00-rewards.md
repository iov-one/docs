## Guaranteed rewards

> IOV will guarantee up to **5000 IOV tokens per month for two years** for up to **15 validators** starting from mainnet launch.

The realized guaranteed monthly reward to a validator is the product of the 5000 IOV tokens and the given validator's quality score relative to the highest quality score.  So, if your quality score is 87% and the highest quality score is 91% then your realized guaranteed reward is `87% / 91% * 5000 IOV tokens = 4780 IOV tokens`.

> Guaranteed rewards are not inflationary.  They are a pre-allocated subsidy of IOV tokens created at genesis that is distributed in an algorithmic manner that decreases to zero over time.

Realized guaranteed rewards are not the only reward for which validators can qualify because validators can be depositors, too.

## Depositor rewards

The IOV token economy has the notion of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zfxAlOXym3S5-yARBIVyJyxGkqq1a-8Tg2jh4L2lLD0" target="_blank">term deposits</a>, particularly to compensate early backers of our efforts while chain turnover grows.  The deposit rate for non-validators is set by the chain's governance board, but for validators the <a href="https://medium.com/iov-internet-of-values/iov-token-economic-cycle-distribution-of-the-bns-turnover-11c4cec202a8" target="blank_">deposit rate is their quality score</a>, which is much higher than the non-validator deposit rate for performant validators.  <a href="https://www.iov.one/#token-timeline-block-section" target="blank_">The IOV token sale is still open to validators</a>, so take advantage of it so that you can make a term deposit for additional rewards.
