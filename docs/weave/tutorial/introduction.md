First of all to understand weave design philosophy and for the sake of programming well designed software, I advise you to read this fine-grained article:
[Things I Learnt The Hard Way (in 30 Years of Software Development)](https://blog.juliobiason.net/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/) \

This tutorial's content is curated from PR discussions of [weave tutorial](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/). If you follow the *PRs* section you can see how to implement blockchain app using weave.
And you can see how the development flow works and what are the issues you should have on your mind while moving forward.
