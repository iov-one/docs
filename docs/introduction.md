**IOV** built the IOV Name Service.

The IOV Name Service is a registry for starnames.

## What is a starname?

A starname is your universal username for the blockchain world.

It enables you to receive crypto-currencies or to log in to blockchain applications in a seamless way. Transferring value becomes fast and easy.

It exists 3 types of starnames:

- iov starname This type of starname ends by *iov like veronika*iov. It is accessible for everyone.

- premium starname This type of starname starts with * like *mycompany or *marta. It is used by company or people who wants to have an exclusive and personalized address.

- business starname This type of starname contains * like antoine*mycompany. A owner of a premium starname can decide to create other business starnames and assign them to different departments.

## How to Get Started

You can send a transaction or query the IOV Name Service by using our client library [IOV Core](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/iov-core) or by using the [IOVNS-rest-api](/docs/iov-name-service/clients/rest-api).
