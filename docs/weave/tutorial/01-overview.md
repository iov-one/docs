First of all to understand weave design philosophy and for the sake of programming well designed software, I advise you to read this fine-grained article:
[Things I Learnt The Hard Way (in 30 Years of Software Development)](https://blog.juliobiason.net/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/)

This documents purpose is to teach you how to make your own weave modules.
Tutorial content is richened with PR discussions of [weave tutorial](https://github.com/iov-one/tutorial/). If you follow the PR reviews you can have a clear understanding of how to design your own module and implement a blockchain app using weave piece by piece.
And you can see how the development flow works and what are the issues you should have on your mind while moving forward.
